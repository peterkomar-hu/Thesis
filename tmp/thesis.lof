\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces (Color online) (a) Normalized average photon number (green ``$+$") and photon-photon correlation function (blue ``$\circ $") for driven mode $c_a$ as a function of laser detuning at zero temperature. Solid lines are calculated from analytic model (see Eqs.\nobreakspace {}(\ref {eq:na}-\ref {eq:g2AA})) and points show full numerical calculation. The average photon number is normalized by $n_0 = (\Omega /\kappa )^2$. (b) Same as in (a) for the undriven mode $c_s$, and (c) for the reflected field $c_R$. In all plots we took $g/\kappa = 20$ and $\gamma /\kappa $ = 0.2. Dots mark features seen at values of detuning $\Delta /g = 0 \unhbox \voidb@x \hbox {\fontsize 6{7pt}\selectfont (A)}, \frac {1}{\sqrt {8}} \unhbox \voidb@x \hbox {\fontsize 6{7pt}\selectfont (B)}, \frac {1}{2} \unhbox \voidb@x \hbox {\fontsize 6{7pt}\selectfont (C)}$ and $\frac {\sqrt {6}}{4} \unhbox \voidb@x \hbox {\fontsize 6{7pt}\selectfont (D)}$. The small discrepancy between the analytic and numerical results in (c) is due to the approximation $g/\kappa \gg 1$ to simplify the expressions in Eqs.\nobreakspace {}(\ref {eq:na}-\ref {eq:g2AA}). Bottom panels A-D illustrate the origin of these features as explained in the text.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces (Color online) Average number (green dashed) and intensity correlation (blue solid) of total photon number in the coupled OM system. Parameters are the same as in Fig.\nobreakspace {}\ref {fig:spectrum}, and dots mark the same detunings. One- and two-photon resonances are seen at C and D, but we see no bunching in the total photon number at $\Delta = 0$ (point A). This reflects the lack of two-photon resonance due to destructive interference (see Eq.\nobreakspace {}\ref {eq:fgr}). }}{26}{figure.2.3}

Vertical dash-dotted lines mark delay times ($\tau _1, \tau _2$) where this amplitude vanishes resulting in the vanishing of $g^{(2)}_{aa}(\tau )$ in (a).

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.7}{\ignorespaces (Color online) Effect of detection of a $c_s$ photon at detuning E ($\Delta /g = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}$). In steady state (gray region on left), the drive is far off-resonant. However, after detection of a $c_s$ photon the system jumps into the conditional subspace (pink region on right). Due to the presence of an extra phonon in this subspace, the drive is resonant and the probability to detect a second photon is much higher than in steady state. This increased probability persists as long as the extra phonon, which decays slowly at rate $\gamma $. }}{30}{figure.2.7}
