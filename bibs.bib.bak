  journal = {Physical Review A},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {87},
  pages = {013839},
  abstract = {We present a detailed theoretical analysis of a weakly driven, multimode
	optomechanical system, in which two optical modes are strongly and
	near-resonantly coupled to a single mechanical mode via a three-wave
	mixing interaction. We calculate one- and two-time intensity correlations
	of the two optical fields and compare them to analogous correlations
	in atom-cavity systems. Nonclassical photon correlations arise when
	the optomechanical coupling g exceeds the cavity decay rate $\kappa$,
	and we discuss signatures of one- and two-photon resonances as well
	as quantum interference. We also find a long-lived correlation that
	decays slowly with the mechanical decay rate $\gamma$, reflecting
	the heralded preparation of a single-phonon state after detection
	of a photon. Our results provide insight into the quantum regime
	of multimode optomechanics, with potential applications for quantum
	information processing with photons and phonons.},

  pages = {582--587},
  abstract = {The development of precise atomic clocks plays an increasingly important
	role in modern society. Shared timing information constitutes a key
	resource for navigation with a direct correspondence between timing
	accuracy and precision in applications such as the Global Positioning
	System. By combining precision metrology and quantum networks, we
	propose a quantum, cooperative protocol for operating a network of
	geographically remote optical atomic clocks. Using nonlocal entangled
	states, we demonstrate an optimal utilization of global resources,
	and show that such a network can be operated near the fundamental
	precision limit set by quantum theory. Furthermore, the internal
	structure of the network, combined with quantum communication techniques,
	guarantees security both from internal and external threats. Realization
	of such a global quantum network of clocks may allow construction
	of a real-time single international time scale (world clock) with
	unprecedented stability and accuracy.},
