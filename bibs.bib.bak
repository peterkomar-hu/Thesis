	coupled to the opto-mechanical system. We show that the probability
	for the additional photon to be emitted by the opto-mechanical cavity
	will exhibit oscillations under a Lorentzian envelope, when the driven

@ARTICLE{AspelmeyerNJP2008,
  author = {Markus Aspelmeyer and Keith Schwab},
  title = {Focus on mechanical systems at the quantum limit},
  journal = {New Journal of Physics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {095001},
  number = {9},
  abstract = {The last five years have witnessed an amazing development in the field
	of nano- and micromechanics. What was widely considered fantasy ten
	years ago is about to become an experimental reality: the quantum
	regime of mechanical systems is within reach of current experiments.
	Two factors (among many) have contributed significantly to this situation.
	As part of the widespread effort into nanoscience and nanofabrication,
	it is now possible to produce high-quality nanomechanical and micromechanical
	resonators, spanning length scales of millimetres to nanometres,
	and frequencies from kilohertz to gigahertz. Researchers coupled
	these mechanical elements to high-sensitivity actuation and readout
	systems such as single-electron transistors, quantum dots, atomic
	point contacts, SQUID loops, high-finesse optical or microwave-cavities
	etc. Some of these ultra-sensitive readout schemes are in principle
	capable of detection at the quantum limit and a large part of the
	experimental effort is at present devoted to achieving this. On the
	other hand, the fact that the groups working in the field come from
	various different physics backgroundsâ€”the authors of this editorial
	are a representative sampleâ€”has been a constant source of inspiration
	for helpful theoretical and experimental tools that have been adapted
	from other fields to the mechanical realm. To name just one example:
	ideas from quantum optics have led to the recent demonstration (both
	in theory and experiment) that coupling a mechanical resonator to
	a high-finesse optical cavity can be fully analogous to the well-known
	sideband-resolved laser cooling of ions and hence is capable in principle
	of cooling a mechanical mode into its quantum ground state. There
	is no doubt that such interdisciplinarity has been a crucial element
	for the development of the field. It is interesting to note that
	a very similar sociological phenomenon occurred earlier in the quantum
	information community, an area which is deeply enriched by the diverse
	backgrounds and approaches of the researchers. As diverse as the
	approaches are the manifold of goals and perspectives for operating
	mechanical systems close to or within the quantum regime. Already
	now, nanomechanical sensors achieve single-molecule mass detection
	and magnetic resonance force detection from single-electron spins
	although they are operated far from quantum. Quantum-limited mechanical
	devices promise a new technology with hitherto unachieved performance
	for high-resolution sensing. This is also of high relevance for macroscopic
	mechanical resonators used in gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore,
	the increasing capability to couple mechanical modes to individual
	quantum systems raises the interesting question of whether mechanics
	can serve as a quantum bus in hybrid implementations of quantum information
	processing. Finally, the possibility of generating quantum superposition
	states that involve displacements of a massive macroscopic object
	(such as the center of mass of a mechanical beam) provides a completely
	new parameter regime for testing quantum theory over the amazing
	range from nanomechanical objects of several picograms up to gram-scale
	mirrors used in gravitational wave interferometers. We are looking
	forward to these fascinating developments! This Focus Issue is intended
	to highlight the present status of the field and to provide both
	introduction and motivation for students and researchers who want
	to get familiar with this exciting area or even want to join it.
	It also complements the conference activities of our community during
	the last year, where a series of dedicated invited sessions at several
	international conferences (APS March Meeting 2008, CLEO/QELS 2008,
	OSA Frontiers in Optics 2008, PQE 2008/2009 etc) culminated in the
	first Gordon Conference on 'Mechanical Systems at the Quantum Limit'.
	Given the fast development of the field it was not surprising to
	see that during the collection of the following contributions new
	progress was reported almost on a monthly basis and new groups entered
	the field. We intend to keep submission to this Focus Issue open
	for some time and invite everyone to share their latest results with
	us. And finally, a note to our fellow colleagues: keep up the good
	work! We would like to call the next Focus Issue 'Mechanical Systems
	IN the Quantum Regime'. Â  Focus on Mechanical Systems at the Quantum

	nanobeams provides flexibility, enabling the independent design and
	optimization of the optics and mechanics of the system. In addition,
	the small gap (\&\#x02248;25 nm) between the two resonators gives

	the optomechanical coupling g exceeds the cavity decay rate $\kappa$,

	decays slowly with the mechanical decay rate $\gamma$, reflecting
	the heralded preparation of a single-phonon state after detection
	of a photon. Our results provide insight into the quantum regime

  abstract = {We consider a generic optomechanical system, consisting of a driven
	optical cavity and a movable mirror attached to a cantilever. Systems
	of this kind (and analogues) have been realized in many recent experiments.
	It is well known that these systems can exhibit an instability towards
	a regime where the cantilever settles into self-sustained oscillations.
	In this paper, we briefly review the classical theory of the optomechanical
	instability, and then discuss the features arising in the quantum
	regime. We solve numerically a full quantum master equation for the
	coupled system, and use it to analyze the photon number, the cantilever's
	mechanical energy, the phonon probability distribution and the mechanical
	Wigner density, as a function of experimentally accessible control
	parameters. When a suitable dimensionless 'quantum parameter' is
	sent to zero, the results of the quantum mechanical model converge
	towards the classical predictions. We discuss this quantum-to-classical
	transition in some detail.},

	to destructive interference for the excitation of an intracavity

  abstract = {Silicon photonics has offered a versatile platform for the recent
	development of integrated optomechanical circuits. However, silicon
	is limited to wavelengths above1.1Â Î¼ m and does not allow device
	operation in the visible spectrum range where low-noise lasers are
	conveniently available. The narrow bandgap of silicon also makes
	silicon optomechanical devices susceptible to strong two-photon absorption
	and free carrier absorption, which often introduce strong thermal
	effects that limit the devices' stability and cooling performance.
	Further, silicon also does not provide the desired lowest order optical
	nonlinearity for interfacing with other active electrical components
	on a chip. On the other hand, aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide-band
	semiconductor widely used in micromechanical resonators due to its
	low mechanical loss and high electromechanical coupling strength.
	In this paper, we report the development of AlN-on-silicon platform
	for low loss, wide-band optical guiding, as well as its use for achieving
	simultaneously high-optical-quality-factor and high-mechanical-quality-factor
	optomechanical devices. Exploiting AlN's inherent second-order nonlinearity
	we further demonstrate electro-optic modulation and efficient second
	harmonic generation in AlN photonic circuits. Our results suggest
	that low-cost AlN-on-silicon photonic circuits are excellent substitutes
	for complementary metal-oxideâ€“semiconductor-compatible photonic
	circuits for building new functional optomechanical devices that
	are free from carrier effects.},
