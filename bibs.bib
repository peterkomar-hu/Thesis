abstract = {We present a detailed theoretical analysis of a weakly driven, multimode optomechanical system, in which two optical modes are strongly and near-resonantly coupled to a single mechanical mode via a three-wave mixing interaction. We calculate one- and two-time intensity correlations of the two optical fields and compare them to analogous correlations in atom-cavity systems. Nonclassical photon correlations arise when the optomechanical coupling g exceeds the cavity decay rate $\kappa$, and we discuss signatures of one- and two-photon resonances as well as quantum interference. We also find a long-lived correlation that decays slowly with the mechanical decay rate $\gamma$, reflecting the heralded preparation of a single-phonon state after detection of a photon. Our results provide insight into the quantum regime of multimode optomechanics, with potential applications for quantum information processing with photons and phonons.},

abstract = {The development of precise atomic clocks plays an increasingly important role in modern society. Shared timing information constitutes a key resource for navigation with a direct correspondence between timing accuracy and precision in applications such as the Global Positioning System. By combining precision metrology and quantum networks, we propose a quantum, cooperative protocol for operating a network of geographically remote optical atomic clocks. Using nonlocal entangled states, we demonstrate an optimal utilization of global resources, and show that such a network can be operated near the fundamental precision limit set by quantum theory. Furthermore, the internal structure of the network, combined with quantum communication techniques, guarantees security both from internal and external threats. Realization of such a global quantum network of clocks may allow construction of a real-time single international time scale (world clock) with unprecedented stability and accuracy.},
