	of nuclear matter. It will also measure the masses, birth rates,
	collisions, and distributions of black holes and neutron stars in
	the universe and probe the cores of supernovae and the very early

  title = {Focus on mechanical systems at the quantum limit},
  journal = {New Journal of Physics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {095001},
  abstract = {The last five years have witnessed an amazing development in the field
	of nano- and micromechanics. What was widely considered fantasy ten
	years ago is about to become an experimental reality: the quantum
	regime of mechanical systems is within reach of current experiments.
	Two factors (among many) have contributed significantly to this situation.
	As part of the widespread effort into nanoscience and nanofabrication,
	it is now possible to produce high-quality nanomechanical and micromechanical
	resonators, spanning length scales of millimetres to nanometres,
	and frequencies from kilohertz to gigahertz. Researchers coupled
	these mechanical elements to high-sensitivity actuation and readout
	systems such as single-electron transistors, quantum dots, atomic
	point contacts, SQUID loops, high-finesse optical or microwave-cavities
	etc. Some of these ultra-sensitive readout schemes are in principle
	capable of detection at the quantum limit and a large part of the
	experimental effort is at present devoted to achieving this. On the
	other hand, the fact that the groups working in the field come from
	various different physics backgroundsâ€”the authors of this editorial
	are a representative sampleâ€”has been a constant source of inspiration
	for helpful theoretical and experimental tools that have been adapted
	from other fields to the mechanical realm. To name just one example:
	ideas from quantum optics have led to the recent demonstration (both
	in theory and experiment) that coupling a mechanical resonator to
	a high-finesse optical cavity can be fully analogous to the well-known
	sideband-resolved laser cooling of ions and hence is capable in principle
	of cooling a mechanical mode into its quantum ground state. There
	is no doubt that such interdisciplinarity has been a crucial element
	for the development of the field. It is interesting to note that
	a very similar sociological phenomenon occurred earlier in the quantum
	information community, an area which is deeply enriched by the diverse
	backgrounds and approaches of the researchers. As diverse as the
	approaches are the manifold of goals and perspectives for operating
	mechanical systems close to or within the quantum regime. Already
	now, nanomechanical sensors achieve single-molecule mass detection
	and magnetic resonance force detection from single-electron spins
	although they are operated far from quantum. Quantum-limited mechanical
	devices promise a new technology with hitherto unachieved performance
	for high-resolution sensing. This is also of high relevance for macroscopic
	mechanical resonators used in gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore,
	the increasing capability to couple mechanical modes to individual
	quantum systems raises the interesting question of whether mechanics
	can serve as a quantum bus in hybrid implementations of quantum information
	processing. Finally, the possibility of generating quantum superposition
	states that involve displacements of a massive macroscopic object
	(such as the center of mass of a mechanical beam) provides a completely
	new parameter regime for testing quantum theory over the amazing
	range from nanomechanical objects of several picograms up to gram-scale
	mirrors used in gravitational wave interferometers. We are looking
	forward to these fascinating developments! This Focus Issue is intended
	to highlight the present status of the field and to provide both
	introduction and motivation for students and researchers who want
	to get familiar with this exciting area or even want to join it.
	It also complements the conference activities of our community during
	the last year, where a series of dedicated invited sessions at several
	international conferences (APS March Meeting 2008, CLEO/QELS 2008,
	OSA Frontiers in Optics 2008, PQE 2008/2009 etc) culminated in the
	first Gordon Conference on 'Mechanical Systems at the Quantum Limit'.
	Given the fast development of the field it was not surprising to
	see that during the collection of the following contributions new
	progress was reported almost on a monthly basis and new groups entered
	the field. We intend to keep submission to this Focus Issue open
	for some time and invite everyone to share their latest results with
	us. And finally, a note to our fellow colleagues: keep up the good
	work! We would like to call the next Focus Issue 'Mechanical Systems
	IN the Quantum Regime'. Â  Focus on Mechanical Systems at the Quantum

	ingredient of managing the flow of information over complex optical

	we suggest a novel approach to light storage involving an optical

	long-lived mechanical vibrations of the array. Under realistic conditions,

	The two-level system consists of a fine-structure doublet in sodium

	intermediate states. The pulses are in the microwave regime and have
	high fidelity and uniform intensity. Experiments show that, despite

  abstract = {We give a review on entanglement purification for bipartite and multipartite
	quantum states, with the main focus on the theoretical work carried
	out by our group in the last couple of years. We discuss entanglement
	purification in the context of quantum communication, where we emphasize
	its close relation to quantum error correction. Various bipartite
	and multipartite entanglement purification protocols are discussed,
	and their performance under idealized and realistic conditions is
	studied. Several applications of entanglement purification in quantum

	system in which a localized GHz frequency mechanical mode of a nanobeam
	resonator is evanescently coupled to a high quality factor (Q \&\#x0003E;
	106) optical mode of a separate nanobeam optical cavity. Using separate
	nanobeams provides flexibility, enabling the independent design and
	optimization of the optics and mechanics of the system. In addition,
	the small gap (\&\#x02248;25 nm) between the two resonators gives
	rise to a slot mode effect that enables a large zero-point optomechanical
	coupling strength to be achieved, with g/2\&\#x003C0; \&\#x0003E;
	300 kHz in a Si3N4 system at 980 nm and g/2\&\#x003C0; \&\#x02248;
	900 kHz in a Si system at 1550 nm. The fact that large coupling strengths
	to GHz mechanical oscillators can be achieved in Si3N4 is important,
	as this material has a broad optical transparency window, which allows
	operation throughout the visible and near-infrared. As an application
	of this platform, we consider wide-band optical frequency conversion
	between 1300 nm and 980 nm, using two optical nanobeam cavities coupled
	on either side to the breathing mode of a mechanical nanobeam resonator.},

	quanta (photons) that do not interact with one another. However,
	it has long been known that the realization of coherent interactions
	between individual photons, akin to those associated with conventional
	massive particles, could enable a wide variety of novel scientific
	and engineering applications. Here we demonstrate a quantum nonlinear
	medium inside which individual photons travel as massive particles
	with strong mutual attraction, such that the propagation of photon
	pairs is dominated by a two-photon bound state. We achieve this through
	dispersive coupling of light to strongly interacting atoms in highly
	excited Rydberg states. We measure the dynamical evolution of the
	two-photon wavefunction using time-resolved quantum state tomography,
	and demonstrate a conditional phase shift exceeding one radian, resulting
	in polarization-entangled photon pairs. Particular applications of
	this technique include all-optical switching, deterministic photonic
	quantum logic and the generation of strongly correlated states of
	light.},

  abstract = {Controlled phase (CPHASE) gates can in principle be realized with

	the ultra-high fidelities required for quantum computation with such
	Rydberg gates is however compromised by experimental inaccuracies
	in pulse amplitudes and timings, as well as by stray fields that
	cause fluctuations of the Rydberg levels. We report here a comparative
	study of analytic and numerical pulse sequences for the Rydberg CPHASE
	gate that specifically examines the robustness of the gate fidelity
	with respect to such experimental perturbations. Analytical pulse
	sequences of both simultaneous and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
	(STIRAP) are found to be at best moderately robust under these perturbations.
	In contrast, optimal control theory is seen to allow generation of
	numerical pulses that are inherently robust within a predefined tolerance
	window. The resulting numerical pulse shapes display simple modulation
	patterns and their spectra contain only one additional frequency
	beyond the basic resonant Rydberg gate frequencies. Pulses of such
	low complexity should be experimentally feasible, allowing gate fidelities
	of order 99.90 - 99.99\% to be achievable under realistic experimental
	conditions.},

	ultra-low-loss filters to eliminate the pump light and separate signal

	source. To detect the photons, we used single-photon detectors based
	on frequency up-conversion. These detectors operated in a non-gated
	mode so that we could use a pulse stream of time correlated entangled
	photon pairs at a high repetition frequency (1 GHz). Using these
	elements, we distributed time-bin entangled photon pairs over 100
	km of dispersion shifted fiber and performed a two-photon interference
	experiment. We obtained a coincidence fringe of 81.6\% visibility
	without subtracting any background noise, such as accidental coincidence
	or dark count, which was good enough to violate Bell's inequality.
	Thus, we successfully distributed time-bin entangled photon pairs

	optomechanical system, in which two optical modes are strongly and
	near-resonantly coupled to a single mechanical mode via a three-wave
	mixing interaction. We calculate one- and two-time intensity correlations
	of the two optical fields and compare them to analogous correlations
	in atom-cavity systems. Nonclassical photon correlations arise when
	the optomechanical coupling g exceeds the cavity decay rate $\kappa$,
	and we discuss signatures of one- and two-photon resonances as well
	as quantum interference. We also find a long-lived correlation that
	decays slowly with the mechanical decay rate $\gamma$, reflecting
	the heralded preparation of a single-phonon state after detection
	of a photon. Our results provide insight into the quantum regime
	of multimode optomechanics, with potential applications for quantum

	It is well known that these systems can exhibit an instability towards
	a regime where the cantilever settles into self-sustained oscillations.
	In this paper, we briefly review the classical theory of the optomechanical
	instability, and then discuss the features arising in the quantum

	coupled system, and use it to analyze the photon number, the cantilever's

	Wigner density, as a function of experimentally accessible control
	parameters. When a suitable dimensionless 'quantum parameter' is

	towards the classical predictions. We discuss this quantum-to-classical

  abstract = {It is well known that classical states of light exhibit shot noise,
	characteristic of independent or uncorrelated particles. For phase
	estimation problems, this leads to a shot-noise limited uncertainty
	of 1/sqrt[N], where N is the number of particles detected. It is
	also well known that the shot-noise limit is not fundamental: squeezed
	states and entangled states can be used for sub-shot-noise phase
	measurements. The uncertainty principle sets a fundamental limit
	of 1/N, known as the "Heisenberg" limit. We have recently demonstrated
	a method, using parametric downconversion and post-selection, to
	generate entangled "NOON" states suitable for sub-shot-noise phase
	measurements [M.W. Mitchell et al, Nature 429, 161 (2004)]. We generated
	a three-photon NOON state and demonstrated three-fold improvement
	in phase resolution with this state. The relationship between phase
	resolution and phase uncertainty depends on prior information about
	the phase being estimated. As in the case of phase measurements with
	squeezed states, extra precision in one dimension is gained at the
	cost of reduced precision in other dimensions. Only when prior information
	is incorporated can entangled-state metrology be applied to beat
	the shot-noise limit. We illustrate this relationship and discuss
	adaptive strategies for phase estimation and the possibility of reaching
	the Heisenberg limit.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the quantum key distribution (QKD) network
	designed and implemented by the European project SE cure CO mmunication
	based on Q uantum C ryptography (SECOQC) (2004â€“2008), unifying
	the efforts of 41 research and industrial organizations. The paper
	summarizes the SECOQC approach to QKD networks with a focus on the
	trusted repeater paradigm. It discusses the architecture and functionality
	of the SECOQC trusted repeater prototype, which has been put into
	operation in Vienna in 2008 and publicly demonstrated in the framework
	of a SECOQC QKD conference held from October 8 to 10, 2008. The demonstration
	involved one-time pad encrypted telephone communication, a secure
	(AES encryption protected) video-conference with all deployed nodes
	and a number of rerouting experiments, highlighting basic mechanisms
	of the SECOQC network functionality. The paper gives an overview
	of the eight point-to-point network links in the prototype and their
	underlying technology: three plug and play systems by id Quantique,
	a one way weak pulse system from Toshiba Research in the UK, a coherent
	one-way system by GAP Optique with the participation of id Quantique
	and the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology (formerly ARC), an entangled
	photons system by the University of Vienna and the AIT, a continuous-variables
	system by Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and
	THALES Research and Technology with the participation of UniversitÃ©
	Libre de Bruxelles, and a free space link by the Ludwig Maximillians
	University in Munich connecting two nodes situated in adjacent buildings
	(line of sight 80 m). The average link length is between 20 and 30
	km, the longest link being 83Â km. The paper presents the architecture
	and functionality of the principal networking agent â€”the SECOQC
	node module , which enables the authentic classical communication
	required for key distillation, manages the generated key material,
	determines a communication path between any destinations in the network,
	and realizes end-to-end secure transport of key material between
	these destinations. The paper also illustrates the operation of the
	network in a number of typical exploitation regimes and gives an
	initial estimate of the network transmission capacity, defined as
	the maximum amount of key that can be exchanged, or alternatively
	the amount of information that can be transmitted with information
	theoretic security, between two arbitrary nodes.},

  abstract = {Quantum computation is a novel way of information processing which
	allows, for certain classes of problems, exponential speedups over
	classical computation. Various models of quantum computation exist,
	such as the adiabatic, circuit and measurement-based models. They
	have been proven equivalent in their computational power, but operate
	very differently. As such, they may be suitable for realization in
	different physical systems, and also offer different perspectives
	on open questions such as the precise origin of the quantum speedup.
	Here, we give an introduction to the one-way quantum computer, a
	scheme of measurement-based quantum computation. In this model, the
	computation is driven by local measurements on a carefully chosen,
	highly entangled state. We discuss various aspects of this computational
	scheme, such as the role of entanglement and quantum correlations.
	We also give examples for ground states of simple Hamiltonians which
	enable universal quantum computation by local measurements.},

  abstract = {In order to investigate distributed quantum computation under restricted
	network resources, we introduce a quantum computation task over the
	butterfly network where both quantum and classical communications
	are limited. We consider deterministically performing a two-qubit
	global unitary operation on two unknown inputs given at different
	nodes, with outputs at two distinct nodes. By using a particular
	resource setting introduced by M. Hayashi [Phys. Rev. A $\backslash$textbf\{76\},
	040301(R) (2007)], which is capable of performing a swap operation
	by adding two maximally entangled qubits (ebits) between the two
	input nodes, we show that unitary operations can be performed without
	adding any entanglement resource, if and only if the unitary operations
	are locally unitary equivalent to controlled unitary operations.
	Our protocol is optimal in the sense that the unitary operations
	cannot be implemented if we relax the specifications of any of the
	channels. We also construct protocols for performing controlled traceless
	unitary operations with a 1-ebit resource and for performing global
	Clifford operations with a 2-ebit resource.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the work on cavity quantum electrodynamics of free
	atoms. In recent years, cavity experiments have also been conducted
	on a variety of solid-state systems resulting in many interesting
	applications, of which microlasers, photon bandgap structures and
	quantum dot structures in cavities are outstanding examples. Although
	these phenomena and systems are very interesting, discussion is limited
	here to free atoms and mostly single atoms because these systems
	exhibit clean quantum phenomena and are not disturbed by a variety
	of other effects. At the centre of our review is the work on the
	one-atom maser, but we also give a survey of the entire field, using
	free atoms in order to show the large variety of problems dealt with.
	The cavity interaction can be separated into two main regimes: the
	weak coupling in cavity or cavity-like structures with low quality
	factors Q and the strong coupling when high- Q cavities are involved.
	The weak coupling leads to modification of spontaneous transitions
	and level shifts, whereas the strong coupling enables one to observe
	a periodic exchange of photons between atoms and the radiation field.
	In this case, atoms and photons are entangled, this being the basis
	for a variety of phenomena observed, some of them leading to interesting
	applications in quantum information processing. The cavity experiments
	with free atoms reached a new domain with the advent of experiments
	in the visible spectral region. A review on recent achievements in
	this area is also given.},

  abstract = {Silicon photonics has offered a versatile platform for the recent
	development of integrated optomechanical circuits. However, silicon
	is limited to wavelengths above1.1Â Î¼ m and does not allow device
	operation in the visible spectrum range where low-noise lasers are
	conveniently available. The narrow bandgap of silicon also makes
	silicon optomechanical devices susceptible to strong two-photon absorption
	and free carrier absorption, which often introduce strong thermal
	effects that limit the devices' stability and cooling performance.
	Further, silicon also does not provide the desired lowest order optical
	nonlinearity for interfacing with other active electrical components
	on a chip. On the other hand, aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide-band
	semiconductor widely used in micromechanical resonators due to its
	low mechanical loss and high electromechanical coupling strength.
	In this paper, we report the development of AlN-on-silicon platform
	for low loss, wide-band optical guiding, as well as its use for achieving
	simultaneously high-optical-quality-factor and high-mechanical-quality-factor
	optomechanical devices. Exploiting AlN's inherent second-order nonlinearity
	we further demonstrate electro-optic modulation and efficient second
	harmonic generation in AlN photonic circuits. Our results suggest
	that low-cost AlN-on-silicon photonic circuits are excellent substitutes
	for complementary metal-oxideâ€“semiconductor-compatible photonic
	circuits for building new functional optomechanical devices that
	are free from carrier effects.},

	Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) laboratories have been
	connected through a 3.45-km optical fiber link. An optical frequency
	standard based on an iodine-stabilized Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm (with
	an instability of $\sim$4{\texttimes}10{\textminus}14 at 1 s) has
	been transferred from JILA to NIST and simultaneously measured in
	both laboratories. In parallel, a hydrogen maser-based radio frequency
	standard (with an instability of $\sim$2.4{\texttimes}10{\textminus}13
	at 1 s) is transferred from NIST to JILA. Comparison between these
	frequency standards is made possible by the use of femtosecond frequency
	combs in both laboratories. The degradation of the optical and rf
	standards that are due to the instability in the transmission channel
	has been measured. Active noise cancellation is demonstrated to improve
	the transfer stability of the fiber link.},
